<h1>Stakeholder Archetypes and Audience Information</h1>

<p>The intended audience of this research is anyone involved in the development of story-based video games, commercially or otherwise. Or, more specifically, anyone involved in the story writing side of game development. This includes everyone from the independent developer to the big name story director. These are any individuals responsible for developing the story of a game.</p>

<p>The available resources therefore range from extensive to no funds, teams of over a hundred to single developers. But the one thing that there is never enough of is time, which is exactly where my research seeks to benefit these people. One of the most pervasive challenges in game development today is how to deliver as enjoyable as possible of a player experience within deadlines and available time. Computer-generated storytelling sets out to aid in what can be the time and energy-intensive process of developing deep and engaging narratives in games. </p>
