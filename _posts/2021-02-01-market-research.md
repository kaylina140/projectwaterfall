<h1>Market Research</h1>

<p>AI storytelling in video games lies at the cross-section between technology and the arts by bringing artificial intelligence, narrative fiction, and game development into one place. Altogether this places computer-generated storytelling research under the umbrella of the arts, entertainment, and recreation sector, as well as the Information sector to some extent. </p>

<p>The arts, entertainment, and recreation market sector is made up of numerous subcategories, and video games are the most valuable of those industries. More than 150 million people play video games in the US alone, and story-driven games are among the most popular. Plus, with people spending so much time at home during the pandemic, video games have become more popular than ever. The video game industry is currently estimated at over $60 billion in the United States alone (Statista 2020). Worldwide, the industry saw a nearly 10% increase in value from 2019 (NewZoo 2020). </p>

<p>Many of the big-name video game developers are behind the story-driven game craze. Ubisoft, Naughty Dog, Rockstar Games, Square Enix, Bethesda Games, and even Nintendo have all produced numerous successful games in this genre, all of which incorperate AI into some aspect of development, most often in adversary decision-making. Each of these companies has their own well-known action-adventure series, such as Assassin's Creed, Grand Theft Auto, The Last of Us, and Skyrim, which all rely on deep and interactive storylines. Even popular games on smaller scales, such as Undertale or Stardew Valley, owe some degree of their success to the quality of their stories.</p>

<p>Computer-generated stories have just started to appear in games as well, ranging from pseudo-AI in games like Rimworld to AI Dungeon, the infinitely generated text-adventure game.</p>
