<h1>Basic Dev Experiments</h1>

<p>Before I could comfortably jump into the technical work of this project, I decided I needed more background knowledge on AI and storytelling. Coming into this research, I've actually never really worked with artifical intelligence before, so I decided to take a step back and become a bit more familiar with the basics. I started perusing some textbooks, wikipedia pages, and other online resources to at least become a little more familiar with the terminology. (For example, I knew theoretically what a "state space" was from my readings last week, but now a much more specific understanding of the term and the ways it is used. Most importantly, I learned a bit about Bayesian Networks, which I think will be valuable to my endeavors. Thanks to <i>Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach</i> and GeeksForGeeks, I've refreshed my memory on search algorithms and generally lessened some of my anxiety surrounding this project.</p>

<p>I have also decided that I really want to focus on the interdisciplinary aspect of this research. I selected this topic because of my additional interests in English and storytelling in general, so I hoped that my experience in and enthusiasm for writing would be an asset for this project. Ideally, approaching my research questions from the position of a writer, not just an engineer, will help me to develop a unique and valuable approach. Based on the research I read through last week, I'm happy to say that it seems like it actually will be. The projects that were most successful took into consideration things that an English major might (like the value of a good character vs a good plot) and not just what a CS student would (like state spaces and algorithms).</p>

<p>Taking this into consideration, I also spent some of my time reading <i>Save the Cat! Writes a Novel</i>, a novel-writing guide with a focus on story structure. It's a system highly regarded in the fiction and film industry, and my hope is that a lot of its lessons can be applied to games as well. The book breaks down a narrative into 3 acts, made up of a total of 15 primary plot points, that all successful stories contain. In a sense, it provides a formula for crafting a story, which is exactly the sort of thing that computers thrive on. My biggest takeaway from this was the focus on the hero's journey, or the ups and downs that a character must experience in order to create an engaging story. It's not just about getting from point A to point B, but also about the moments where all seems lost, or victory seems certain, and twisting expectations on their head. This is something I plan to integrate into Project Waterfall: a way to track the relative success of a player in order to best determine when to throw them curveballs and when they need a light at the end of the tunnel.</p>

<p>I looked back at some of last week's readings in the hopes of finding some existing code I could play around with, but didn't have much luck. <i><a href="https://github.com/Latitude-Archives/AIDungeon">AI Dungeon</a></i>, however, is an open-source project, so I was able to spend a little time poking around in there, even though it's not quite as relevant as a text-based game. I was surprised at first that it was written in Python, but after thinking about it, it made a lot of sense considering it is just text-based. There was a <i>lot</i> of code to look through, a lot of which leaned more towards machine learning than basic AI and was thus outside my wheelhouse, but it was still really interesting to see some of what goes into a story-generation success story. Next week I hope to poke around the code a bit more, and also try out playing the game, since I actually never have before.</p>

<p>As far as actual technical experimentation goes, I didn't get too far past the brainstorming stage. I did set up a basic 2D project in Unity (using C#) to be the basis of my technical experimentation this semester, with the basic premise of a zombie-suvival style game. The AI Storyteller will create events, like hordes or lightning strikes, based on the player's current "success level" - aka how well they are doing given the events thus far - in order to craft a more structured narrative. Therefore, most of my technical experimentation this week was in brainstorming events, and also coming up with a way to track a player's success level.</p>

<p>Most of my experimentation took place in <a href="http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~gbrown/bayes_nets/">BayANet</a>, a student-developed tool for visualizing Bayesian Networks, that I used to visualize and represent some of my basic ideas. I started out with a really simple graph, representing events that could potentially lead to a fire in-game, along with some sample basic likelihoods of the events happening during a given event space.</p>

<p>From there, I branched out to add some sample consequences of the event, with some generic likelihoods. (In a real game, of course, the player's actions would also affect the outcome too.) More interestingly, I also integrated a sample of a check for the player's success level (or "morale," as I've started to think of it) before determining the next event. In the case where a player successfully handled (or recovered from) an event, their success level should be high, which gives them a higher chance of a negative event, such as a zombie horde attacking. Whereas if the player has struggled with the previous event(s), they are much more likely to get a positive event, such as a resource drop.</p>

<p>I didn't get quite as much game-technical work done as I would have liked this week, but I do feel much more prepared to go forward with this project, and am looking forward to digging deeper next week and beyond.</p>
